# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

I would like to see the menu section updated with a submitable button. This will allow the user to select what they would like to order and then submit it. Possibly add some kind of celebration animation once the order is complete.
